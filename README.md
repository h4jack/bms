- You would not be charged for any SMS dispatched as a consequence of this script.
- For best performance, use single thread with considerable delay time.
- Always ensure that you are using the latest version and have Python 3.
- This application must not be used to cause harm/discomfort/trouble to others.
- By using this, you agree that you cannot hold the contributors responsible for any misuse.

Check your Python version by typing in
```shell script
$ python --version
```

```shell script
Python 3.12.1
```
